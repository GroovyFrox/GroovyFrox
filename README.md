- 👋 Hi, I’m René
- 👀 I’m interested in webdesign, playing music (guitar mostly) and videogames, learning how to code - still figuring things out as I go - and my two cats. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5 and CSS3. I will continue with a bit of JS to have a nice foundation for front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that may help me figure out how development works and will make me a better programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me: just send me a DM!
